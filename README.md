3. Navigate to `api/` directory and use `yarn` to install dependencies
4. Use `yarn serve` to start the API server (development mode)

## Webapp Setup
1. Change default API URL in `webapp/src/main.js`, `webapp/src/store/index.js` and `webapp/src/plugins/axios.js`
2. Navigate to `webapp/` directory and use `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm run serve` to start the webapp (development mode)

# ‚ûï Installation / Requirements

These technologies listed below are required to run the project properly:

- Docker (for PostgreSQL database)
- Node (tested with Node v14.17)
- Yarn (for API)
- NPM (tested with v6.14, for webapp)

## API Installation
Navigate to `api/` directory and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

## Webapp Installation
Navigate to `webapp/` directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

# üî® Setting up PostgreSQL database

Start docker then navigate to the `api/` directory and use `docker-compose up` to set up the database.
You can access the database using `pgAdmin` by accessing the app url and the port configured in `api/.env` file.

# üöÄ Running the app (development mode)

After installing the dependencies and setting up the database:

1. **Start the API server**: Navigate to `api/` directory and run `yarn serve`
